    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="lead">A brief overview of my academic path, interests and direction.</p>
    <hr class="hr" />
    <p>
      I am currently in my third year of a bilingual double degree in Economics and
      Business Administration at the University of Málaga, with a current GPA of
      8.14/10. As part of my academic and personal development, I plan to spend a
      year abroad through the Erasmus program, an experience I see as an
      opportunity to broaden both my academic perspective and personal growth.

      Financial markets represent, for me, a structured way of understanding how
      the world works. Through market behavior, it is possible to observe not only
      economic fundamentals, but also psychological and intangible factors that
      influence decision-making. Technical analysis plays a key role in this
      process, as it helps interpret the direction and behavior of assets and
      companies over time. In parallel, my interest in macroeconomics stems from
      its ability to explain how relationships between countries and institutions
      translate into real consequences for households and societies.

      Alongside my academic commitments, I have worked as a waiter on weekends,
      which has required me to effectively balance my studies with professional
      responsibilities. This experience has strengthened my organizational skills,
      sense of commitment, and ability to work as part of a large team. Working in a
      fast-paced environment has also helped me develop resilience, adaptability,
      and the ability to perform under pressure.

      Looking ahead, I am convinced that artificial intelligence will open up
      significant opportunities and represent a major transformation across
      economic and business environments. My exposure to entrepreneurship and
      technology-focused programs such as 321Sputnik has further reinforced this
      perspective, strengthening my interest in exploring how technology and
      economics will increasingly converge in the future.
